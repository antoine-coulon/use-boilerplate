## About the database

<b>It's very easy to add a boilerplate that is not registered yet. <br /></b>
Register your favorites boilerplates to the DB by making a Pull Request on the dedicated repository <a href="https://github.com/antoine-coulon/awesome-universal-boilerplates">awesome-universal-boilerplates</a>. By doing that, you'll be able to use them directly from the CLI.
